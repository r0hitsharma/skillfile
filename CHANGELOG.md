# Changelog

All notable changes to skillfile are documented here.

## v1.2.1 - 14-03-2026

### Added

- **Personal platform config** - platform preferences can now be stored in a user-global TOML config file (`~/.config/skillfile/config.toml`) instead of the committed Skillfile. Useful in shared repos where each developer uses different AI tools.
  - `skillfile init` now asks where to store platform config: personal (recommended for shared repos) or Skillfile (shared with team)
  - Existing config from both sources shown during `init` with labels ("Skillfile" / "personal config")
  - Precedence rule: Skillfile install targets always override personal config
  - All commands (`status`, `diff`, `pin`, `unpin`, `resolve`) fall back to personal config when Skillfile has no install lines
  - `install` prints "Using platform targets from personal config" when falling back
- **Smarter init outro** - when the Skillfile already has entries (e.g. after cloning), the wizard now tells you how many and suggests `skillfile install` as the next step.

### Changed

- **Binary size reduced** - release profile now uses `opt-level = "s"` (optimize for size), bringing the binary from ~4.2 MB to ~3.4 MB.
- **Personal config is the default init choice** - the destination picker now lists personal config first with a tip about avoiding merge conflicts in shared repos.
- **Status formatting extracted** - `format_entry_status` is now a standalone function, no behavior change.

### Fixed

- **"No install targets" in shared repos** - if a Skillfile had entries but no `install` lines (common when teams don't want to commit platform preferences), every command failed. Now falls back to personal config so each developer can set their own platforms without touching the shared Skillfile.

## v1.2.0 - 13-03-2026

### Added

- **Interactive init wizard** — `skillfile init` now uses a modern setup wizard (cliclack) with arrow-key navigation and space-to-toggle platform selection. No more typing platform names manually.
  - Scope picker: choose `local`, `global`, or `both` (adds both scopes per platform)
  - Entity type hints next to each platform ("skill, agent" or "skill only")
  - Existing platforms pre-selected when re-running `init` on a repo that already has a Skillfile
- **Clone flow guidance** — when you run `skillfile install` for the first time after cloning a repo, it now shows which platforms are configured and suggests `skillfile init` to add yours.

### Changed

- **`init` requires an interactive terminal** — running `init` in CI or piped input now errors with a clear message pointing to `skillfile add` as the non-interactive alternative.
- **CI pipeline restructured** — static checks (fmt + clippy) now gate test jobs, saving CI minutes on bad pushes. Functional tests run under coverage. macOS gets its own test job.
- **`registry.rs` split into modules** — the 1479-line file is now `registry/mod.rs`, `registry/agentskill.rs`, `registry/skillssh.rs`, `registry/skillhub.rs`.
- **Workspace-level clippy lints** — complexity thresholds (cognitive complexity, line count, nesting depth, argument count) are now enforced via `[workspace.lints.clippy]`.
- **Test crate restructured** — subprocess-based tests moved to a dedicated `tests/` workspace crate with shared binary-resolution helpers. Network tests wrapped with retry (3 attempts, 2s delay).

### Fixed

- **Stale binary in CI** — functional tests spawn the compiled `skillfile` binary as a subprocess. `cargo test` does not produce this binary, and the CI cache (keyed on `Cargo.lock`, not source hash) could serve one compiled from a previous commit. A pre-build step now ensures the binary is always fresh.

## v1.1.0 - 12-03-2026

### Added

- **Search & discovery** - find skills and agents across [agentskill.sh](https://agentskill.sh/), [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/), and [skillhub.club](https://skillhub.club/) from the CLI. Results are sorted by popularity and deduplicated across registries.
  - Interactive TUI with split-pane preview (default in a terminal)
  - Plain text and JSON output modes (`--no-interactive`, `--json`)
  - Filter by registry (`--registry`) or minimum security score (`--min-score`)
  - Select a result to add it directly to your Skillfile

- **4 new platform adapters** - deploy to 7 AI platforms from a single manifest:
  - Cursor (`.cursor/skills/`, `.cursor/agents/`)
  - Windsurf (`.windsurf/skills/`)
  - OpenCode (`.opencode/skills/`, `.opencode/agents/`)
  - GitHub Copilot (`.github/skills/`, `.github/agents/`)

- **Update notifications** - checks GitHub Releases in the background and shows a notice when a newer version is available. Cached for 24 hours, opt out with `SKILLFILE_NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER=1`.

### Changed

- **README restructured** - replaced command reference tables with a Key Features section linking to dedicated docs. Added GitHub token callout in Quick Start, new Lock File and Search & Discovery sections, all 7 platforms in the Supported Platforms table.
- **Search results default to 20** (was 10) for better coverage across registries.
- **Per-registry result limiting removed** - search now fetches up to 100 results from each registry before applying the global limit, so results from smaller registries aren't drowned out.

### Fixed

- **Update notification now reliably displays** - switched from non-blocking `try_recv` to a 2-second timeout so the background check has time to complete before the process exits.
- **Removed sentinel cache write** that prevented update notices from appearing on subsequent runs within 24 hours.
- **Fixed test against wrong repo** - `list_repo_skill_entries_real_another_repo` was testing against a Jupyter notebook repo with no `.md` skill files.

## v1.0.1 — 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- **Local directory entries now deploy correctly** — `is_dir_entry()` only inspected GitHub `path_in_repo`, so local directory sources were silently treated as single files. `fs::copy(dir, file.md)` failed without error, and `install` printed success with nothing written. Now uses filesystem truth (`source.is_dir()`) as a fallback.
- **Renamed GitHub repos no longer fail silently** — when a repository has been renamed, `resolve_github_sha` now detects the rename via the GitHub API and tells you the new name, instead of a generic "could not resolve" error.

### Changed

- **Parallel sync** — `skillfile sync` and `skillfile install` now resolve SHAs and fetch entries in parallel using scoped threads. Manifests with many entries sync significantly faster.
- **HTTP redirect auth headers preserved** — ureq now keeps the `Authorization` header on same-host HTTPS redirects. This fixes 401 errors when GitHub returns a 301 for renamed repositories.
- Progress output is now atomic (full lines via `eprintln!`) — no more garbled interleaved output when entries sync in parallel.

---

## v0.9.0 — 2026-03-09

### Added

- **`skillfile pin --dry-run`** — preview what would be pinned without writing patches
- **`skillfile resolve --abort`** — clear pending conflict state without merging (escape hatch if you kill the editor mid-resolve)
- Quoted fields in the Skillfile — paths with spaces now work: `github skill "path with spaces/foo.md"`
- Inline comments — `github skill owner/repo path  # my note` now works correctly
- Duplicate entry name warnings during parsing
- Orphaned lock entry detection in `validate`
- Duplicate install target detection in `validate`

### Changed

- **Symlink mode removed** — `--link` flag is gone; all installs are now copy-only. This simplifies the patch system and the upcoming Rust rewrite.
- Lock file keys are now sorted deterministically (no more spurious git diffs when entries sync in different order)
- Better error on upstream 404 — now suggests checking that the path exists in the repo
- "Skillfile not found" errors now suggest running `skillfile init`
- Conflict errors now include SHA context and mention `resolve --abort`
- Entry names validated as filesystem-safe (`[a-zA-Z0-9._-]` only)
- Install scope validated (`global` or `local` only — unknown scopes now error instead of silently defaulting)
- UTF-8 BOM handling — Skillfiles saved with a byte order mark (common on Windows) now parse correctly
- Binary files in directory entries no longer crash sync

---

## v0.8.0 — 2026-03-09

### Changed

- All machine-managed state now lives under `.skillfile/` instead of being scattered at the repo root:
  - Upstream cache: `.skillfile/cache/` (was `.skillfile/`)
  - Pending conflict state: `.skillfile/conflict` (was `Skillfile.conflict`)
  - Your customisations: `.skillfile/patches/` (was `Skillfile.patches/`)
- `skillfile init` now writes the correct `.gitignore` entries automatically — no manual `.gitignore` editing required

---

## v0.7.0 — 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Gemini CLI adapter** — skills deploy to `.gemini/skills/`, agents to `.gemini/agents/`
- **Codex adapter** — skills deploy to `.codex/skills/` (Codex has no agent directory)
- One `Skillfile`, three tools: `claude-code`, `gemini-cli`, `codex`
- `skillfile init` now lists all registered adapters automatically

---

## v0.6.0 — 2026-03-09

### Changed

- Parallel file downloads — multiple entries are fetched concurrently
- SHA resolution cache — entries sharing the same repo+ref make only one API call
- Internal package restructure (no user-facing changes)
- Test suite restructured into unit / integration / functional layers

---

## v0.5.0 — 2026-03-09

### Added

- **`skillfile pin <name>`** — capture your edits to an installed upstream entry; changes survive future upstream updates
- **`skillfile unpin <name>`** — discard your customisations; revert to pure upstream on next install
- **`skillfile diff <name>`** — after a conflict, show what changed on the upstream side
- **`skillfile resolve <name>`** — three-way merge your customisations with upstream changes in `$MERGETOOL`
- `install` now silently applies patches after fetching and aborts loudly if upstream changes conflict with your customisations
- `install --update` auto-captures any local edits before re-fetching upstream
- `status` shows `[pinned]` and `[modified]` labels per entry

---

## v0.4.0 — 2026-03-09

### Added

- **`skillfile add`** — add an entry to the Skillfile without hand-editing it
- **`skillfile remove`** — remove an entry and clear its cache
- **`skillfile validate`** — check the Skillfile for syntax errors, unknown platforms, and duplicate names
- **`skillfile format`** — format and sort the Skillfile
- Directory entries — a GitHub path can now point to a directory; all files are fetched and deployed individually

---

## v0.3.0 — 2026-03-09

### Added

- **`skillfile install`** — fetch and deploy in one step
- **`skillfile init`** — interactive wizard to configure which platforms to install for
- `install  <platform>  <scope>` lines in the Skillfile configure deploy targets (written by `init`)
- Global scope (`~/.claude/`) and local scope (`.claude/` relative to repo root) both supported
- `--copy` flag to copy files instead of symlinking (now the default since v0.5.0)

---

## v0.2.0 — 2026-03-09

### Added

- **`Skillfile.lock`** — records the exact commit SHA for every upstream entry
- `sync` skips entries whose SHA already matches the lock
- **`skillfile status`** — shows which entries are locked, unlocked, or outdated
- Setup is now fully reproducible: `git clone` + `skillfile install` gives byte-identical results

---

## v0.1.0 — 2026-03-09

### Added

- `Skillfile` manifest format — line-oriented, space-delimited, human-editable
- `github`, `local`, and `url` source types
- `skill` and `agent` entity types
- **`skillfile sync`** — fetch community entries into `.skillfile/cache/`, write `.meta` files
- GitHub source fetches from `raw.githubusercontent.com` — no cloning required
